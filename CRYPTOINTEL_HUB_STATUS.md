## 🏛️ System Architecture: Three Pillars

### 🏰 Pillar A: Luno Monitor (The Fortress)
*Strategic wealth accumulation for long-term cycles (XRP, BTC, ETH).*
- **Logic**: Confluence-based entry at extreme discounts
- **Alerting**: Throttled Telegram notifications for high-conviction (>75 score) triggers
- **Philosophy**: Buy the fear, hold for the cycle
- **Status**: ✅ Active, monitoring MYR pairs

### 🧪 Pillar B: Trading Bots (The Lab)
*Active automated trading on MEXC Global ($14K Allocation).*
- **Environment**: Multi-bot ensemble running on VPS via PM2
- **Risk Control**: Global Circuit Breaker + Asset Exposure Limits + Regime Detection
- **Active Bots**: 5 strategies (Grid BTC/ETH, SMA Trend, Buy-the-Dip, Hidden Gem)
- **Performance**: +$6K profit in 2 weeks (paper trading)
- **Status**: ✅ Active, ready for selective live deployment

### 🧠 Pillar C: Intelligence (The Brain)
*Multi-asset decision support with dual scoring systems.*
- **Confluence V2**: Technical scoring for BTC, ETH, DOGE (0-100)
- **Regulatory Scorer**: Fundamental scoring for XRP, ADA, SOL (0-100)
- **Asset Classifier**: Routes to appropriate scorer automatically
- **Coverage**: 11 configured assets
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed locally, tested, ready for VPS

## 🎯 Intelligence Systems

### Confluence V2 (Technical Assets)
**Used For**: BTC, ETH, DOGE, LTC, BCH

**Scoring Breakdown (0-100)**:
- Technical (30pts): RSI, EMA crossovers, volume
- Trend (30pts): Price vs SMA200, BTC macro
- News (20pts): Sentiment from CryptoPanic
- Volume (20pts): Spike detection

**Regime Detection**:
- `BULL_CONFIRMED`: 1.25x position size
- `TRANSITION_BULLISH`: 0.60x
- `UNDEFINED`: 0.20x
- `BEAR_CONFIRMED`/`CRISIS`: 0.00x (freeze)

### Regulatory Scorer (Fundamental Assets)
**Used For**: XRP, ADA, SOL, MATIC, LINK, DOT

**Scoring Breakdown (0-100)**:
- Regulatory Progress (40pts): SEC status, ETFs, global compliance
- Institutional Adoption (30pts): Partnerships, integrations, holdings
- Ecosystem Development (20pts): GitHub activity, network growth
- Market Position (10pts): Price vs MA200, relative strength

**Example - XRP Current Score**:
```
Regulatory:     30/40  (SEC victory, ETFs approved)
Institutional:  22/30  (UAE banks, RLUSD launched)
Ecosystem:      13/20  (EVM sidechain development)
Market:          5/10  (Below MA200, stable vs BTC)
─────────────────────
TOTAL:          70/100 → BUY (HIGH confidence)

vs Confluence V2: 1.8/100 → AVOID ❌
```

**Difference**: 68.2 points - massive correction using right tool for regulatory asset!

## 🔬 Infrastructure & Database

### Databases
| Database | Purpose | Size | Records |
|----------|---------|------|---------|
| `trades_v3_paper.db` | Bot trading | Primary | All paper trades |
| `intelligence.db` | Scoring | Separate | Regulatory scores |
| Luno local DB | Monitor | Isolated | Price alerts |

**Key Feature**: Complete database isolation ensures bot safety

### VPS Deployment
- **Environment**: Linux Ubuntu (PM2 Process Management)
- **Monitoring**: Real-time log tailing (`pm2 logs`)
- **Resilience**: Automated circuit breaker reset and heartbeat monitoring
- **Location**: `/Antigravity/antigravity/scratch/crypto_trading_bot/`
- **Commands**: `pm2 status`, `pm2 logs crypto_bot`, `pm2 restart crypto_bot`
